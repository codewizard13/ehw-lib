        <strong>Single center experience with medical cannabis in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome </strong> (Thaler, 2018, Oct. 1):
        <ul>
            <li>"[Medical cannabis] seems to hold promise in the treatment of GTS as it demonstrated high subjective satisfaction by most patients however not without side effects and should be further investigated as a treatment option for this syndrome."</li>

        <ul>
            <li>"Following administration of a daily dosage of 10 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol combined with 20 mg cannabidiol (CBD), the [female patient with treatment-resistant Tourette syndrome] showed a rapid and highly significant improvement in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. ... It can be speculated whether the beneficial effects may rely on the pharmacological properties of cannabidiol."</li>

        <strong>Preliminary Evidence on Cannabis Effectiveness and Tolerability for Adults With Tourette Syndrome </strong> (Elia Abi-Jaoude, 2017, May 3):
        <ul>
            <li>"The authors retrospectively evaluated effectiveness and tolerability of cannabis in 19 adults with Tourette syndrome. Tics scores decreased by 60%, and 18 of the 19 participants were at least 'much improved.' Cannabis was generally well tolerated, although most participants reported side effects."</li>

        <strong>A Systematic Review of the Evidence for Medical Marijuana in Psychiatric Indications </strong> (Wilkinson, 2016):
        <ul>
            <li>"No [randomized clinical trials] have thus far examined the efficacy of marijuana for Tourette’s disorder, PTSD, or Alzheimer’s disease. Lower-quality studies examined the efficacy of marijuana, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and nabilone; the strength of evidence for the use of cannabinoids for these conditions is very low at the present time. The consequences of chronic cannabinoid exposure includes tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal. Early and persistent marijuana use has been associated with the emergence of psychosis. Marijuana impairs attention, memory, IQ, and driving ability."</li>

        <strong>Cannabinoids for Medical Use: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis </strong> (Whiting, 2015):
        <ul>
            <li>"There was moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that cannabinoids were associated with improvements in nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, weight gain in HIV infection, sleep disorders, and Tourette syndrome. Cannabinoids were associated with an increased risk of short-term [adverse events]."</li>

            <li>"In conclusion, our data are in agreement with anecdotal reports and a pilot study suggesting that Δ9-THC treatment in patients suffering from TS has no detrimental effect on neuropsychological performance."</li>
