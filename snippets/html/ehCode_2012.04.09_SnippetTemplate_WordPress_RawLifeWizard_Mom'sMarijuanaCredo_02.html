<h2>Legalize Marijuana</h2>
<h3 style="padding-bottom:0px;margin-bottom:1.25em;">By Sandy Harriman</h3>
<div class="para1">      Marijuana, which was better known as hemp since our country was founded, should be legalized in all of the fifty United States. I will explain to you why I believe that The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 never should have been passed in the first place. The marijuana plant, also known as hemp or cannabis is a very beneficial product used throughout the world for thousands of years.</div>
<div class="para1">     I was twelve or thirteen the first time I heard the word marijuana. I was sitting in my sixth-grade class with about thirty other interested students, when somebody from the police department or some such legal society came to our school to teach us about the evils of drugs. I remember that it was a video called Reefer Madness. It told people that a man, while under the influence of marijuana, killed his entire family with an ax. We were told that marijuana was more deadly than cocaine or heroin. I can recall the gasps throughout the classroom as the video played.  I believed the authoritative figures in my life back then, because adults would not lie; especially the police. I wasn’t about to do any drugs, illegal or otherwise. I didn’t go anywhere alone for fear that something horrendous would befall me.</div>
