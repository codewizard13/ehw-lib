<h3>Mom's New Laptop</h3>
My mom recently bought an ASUS X401A 14" Laptop which was equipped without an optical (CD/DVD) drive, and for wireless network connection only. When I'm at her house, I have her <a class="zem_slink" title="SEHK: 4331" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=HKG:4331" target="_blank" rel="googlefinance">DELL</a> desktop connected (wired), and my <a class="zem_slink" title="NYSE: HPQ" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:HPQ" target="_blank" rel="googlefinance">HP</a> laptop and two cell phones, all 3 connected <a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">wirelessly</a>. <em><strong>She hasn't been able to get on the internet ever with her ASUS laptop</strong></em>, and it's a product that was purchased by the original owner (Mom bought off a girl on Craigslist) only a few months ago.
<h3>Symptoms &amp; Troubleshooting</h3>
As far as I can tell there's nothing really wrong with it except that it won't connect to the internet (and the touchpad sucks, but that's a different blog).  The symptoms are this:
<ol>
	<li>HP laptop running <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows XP" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="homepage">XP SP3</a> connects to the home wireless network fine.</li>
	<li>ASUS will not connect to home (<a class="zem_slink" title="Comcast" href="http://comcast.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Comcast</a>) wireless network.  The OS is Windows 7 Media Center Edition.  It says "<strong>Connected</strong>" under "<a class="zem_slink" title="wireless internet" href="http://t-mobile-coverage.t-mobile.com" target="_blank" rel="tmobile">Wireless Network</a> Connection". But, at the same time it says "<span style="color: red; background: yellow;"><em><strong>Currently connected to: Unidentified network - No <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Internet</a> access</strong></em></span>" ... Very contradictory in my view</li>
	<li>Subsequently the ASUS, after not successfully connecting to home network, when taken back to Best Buy, connected fine to their in-store wireless network!</li>
</ol>
I'm not really sure where to go from here.  She tried calling Comcast for technical help with their product and instead of helping they tried to extort her out of $35.95 a month for technical support!
<h3>Share Your Experience</h3>
If anyone has any suggestions, or has run into this type of technical problem recently, please feel free to comment below.  I know this isn't a bulletin board but I'm okay with starting a comment stream on this post to try and get this solved so my mom can finally use her computer the way she needs to.  Thanks for your anticipated comments!!!
