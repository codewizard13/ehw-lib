Growing up, Grandma was the best cook I knew. She could make anything from Spanish rice to potato boats to macaroni and cheese to apple crisp.

Now I’ve always been fascinated with wizards, witches, conjurers, and magicians. To me, cooking was a kind of magic and recipes were its spells. As a young’un I watched Grandma and tried to learn as many of these “spells” as I could, which became useful when I had to start preparing meals for the family around age eleven.

But, one of the best, most delicious, most interesting and easiest recipes I learned didn’t involve any cooking at all! No sir. Just a blender, greens, and some fruit. I’m talking about the SMOOTHIE.

A smoothie is a fruity drink that is part solid, part liquid and if done right, all delicious. Grandma first started drinking smoothies when she began the Weight Watchers diet many years ago. She had a smoothie for breakfast as a meal replacement because it literally counted as zero calories, but at the same time, it was filling. Some benefits of smoothies include dramatic long-term healthy weight loss, greater energy and stamina, and better cardiovascular health. The only side effect is that due to water content, drinking too many (more than four) per day could give you a case of the runs. Your health is important so please consult a trusted health practitioner before adding smoothies to your health regimen.

In any case, for most people, a smoothie in the morning (instead of bacon and eggs or cereal) is a great beginning to an energetic day.

To get you started, here is a recipe for a simple, delicious Strawberry-Banana smoothie:
