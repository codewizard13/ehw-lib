Hi folks,

I've been receiving some tech questions lately so I decided I'd start answering them on the blog so others can benefit as well.

Our next question is from Nadine in Houston, TX:
<div class="qaWrapper" style="background: #cfd2d2; padding: 30px;margin-bottom:12px;">
<div class="questionWrap" style="&quot;margin-bottom: 12px;">

<span class="questionHeader" style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span>
<div class="questionContent">How do I schedule multiple posts in WordPress.com?  For instance, let's say I want to make a queue or stack of posts, and the set up a rule that automatically publishes each post at certain intervals.  So, if I write 10 posts before going on vacation, I can set it up so that the next  one in the queue will publish itself to my blog every 3 days, or on some similar schedule.  I know you can schedule each post individually in WordPress.com by manually configuring the date on each post, but I'm looking for some automation to save time and do stuff in bulk.</div>

<div class="answerContent">Great question Nadine.  Unfortunately, in WordPress.com you are only able to schedule posts one at a time.  On the other hand, if you self-host a WordPress.org-based blog then you have some more options.  One plugin that has high ratings is <a title="Plugin - WordPress Editorial Calendar" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/editorial-calendar/" target="_blank">Editorial Calendar</a>.  This gives you a calendar schedule view, you can schedule for multiple authors, drag and drop between days.  Overall, this one really gives you a lot of control options.  If you are hosting your own site, I'd say give it a try.</div>
