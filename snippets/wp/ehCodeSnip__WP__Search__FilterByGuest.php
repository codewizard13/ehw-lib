Type: WordPress Code Snippet
TITLE: EH: Search Results - Filter by CPT Guest
Author: Eric Hepperle
Date Created: 2023-11-10

DESCRIPTION:

- Display only search results of post type 'guest'.

- $parent_slug : this is an id you make up. It should be self explanatory, in this case 'adminbar-date-time'
- 'top-secondary' : tells WP to put this node / link / text on the right side
- the "600" in add_action() : means keep it on the leftmost of that rightmost section
- $title : This the text that actually displays in the admin bar. Can be text, variables, and HTML. Here we calculate the date and time first as $local_time and the result of thatÂ  variable is what will display in the admin bar. If we wanted we could do 'title' => __( 4 * 8 ), and "32" is what would be shown in the admin bar.
- href : set as "null" because no link is needed
- Finally, HOVER is disabled for all children of the menu item
