Parking is fairly reasonable, and the staff very nice.  Not sure if this would be an evening place to eat, however if you're looking for a healthy lunch while wanting to visit your local grocery store, then this is a great place to visit in downtown Birmingham.

Definitely worth a trip to visit and explore.",3.8

On this trip the the veggies didn't look to good. The zucchini had small holes in it, the squash was molding and the bell peppers looked damaged. We grabbed some cotton candy grapes while there and those were good. The plums were sour and the pears had little tiny holes in them as well. Unfortunately I didn't realize the holes until I got home so I ended up chunking those items. I also picked up some chicken drumsticks and a small chuck roast. The prices of the meat were super reasonable. Not sure if I went on a bad day, but I'll try the veggies again. ",2

Was treated Friday afternoon. Dr Ruth was awesome. This was my first time to get cupping done. I wasn't sure what treatment she would recommend for the numbness in my hand and foot but she did a treatment of acupuncture and cupping. The treatment was 1.5 hours and it cost 75.00. I would recommend this over deep tissue massage if you are in pain.    Some of the cups were a little painful but I found myself very relaxed after a while and I caught myself falling asleep on the table.  My wife who has RA has also been to see her and she also believes that this therapy works well.,5
