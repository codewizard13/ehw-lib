- [ ] Backup #CSITE #EHW with Duplicator
- [ ] Give all top menu pages same look and feel.


### Backed Up with Duplicator:

- Ensure no previous backups
- Run WP-Optimize on databases
- Screenshot dashboard

- [ ] Delete extra themes

- [ ] Collect and zip good working plugins before deleting them

#GOTCHA: Remember to disable SSL plugin on restore! (on local)

- Database only archive: ~96 MB

- Download wp-content subfolders zipped from website files:
  
  - uploads
  - themes
  - plugins
  
- Download all other non-database driven folders & projects

- Any WordPress or database-driven apps in subfolders will need to be downloaded individually

- Download the "dir" folder

- Create thumbnail "screenshot.png"  (1200 x 900) dimensions [for theme]

#GOTCHA: Did NOT install and verify the backup
