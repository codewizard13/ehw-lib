<section class="ehw-doc-descr">

This folder contains personal catalog information that is safe to store or share digitally. The catalogs here focus on descriptive, non-sensitive data — suitable for documenting collections such as books, media, digital assets, or gardening records — while consciously avoiding any materials that could reveal private, valuable, or security-sensitive details.

## ⚠️ Catalog Types to Avoid



Do not include catalogs that could identify, expose, or imply ownership of valuable items. Even without explicit addresses or values, collectors’ data often signals possession of high-value materials and can increase risk of theft or targeted intrusion.

- Personal property inventories (electronics, art, antiques, jewelry)
- Tools, firearms, or high-end equipment
- Hobby or collectible records (coins, stamps, memorabilia, handcrafted art)
- Any materials with valuations, locations, or identifying serial numbers


---


## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use general, descriptive data — avoid prices or storage locations.  
- Never include serial numbers, appraisals, or GPS data.  
- Avoid cataloging hobbies or collectibles linked to valuable assets.  
- Encrypt and securely back up any sensitive inventories elsewhere.  
- Periodically review and redact catalog contents before versioning or sharing.
